## When This Task Runs

This task runs when:
- A new project needs performance guardrails from the start
- Performance regressions keep occurring because there are no automated checks
- The team wants to prevent performance degradation as features are added
- A performance audit was completed and budgets need to enforce the improvements
- `*perf-budget` or `*setup-perf-budget` is invoked

This task does NOT run when:
- A performance audit is needed first (use `performance-audit`)
- Specific optimizations need to be made (use `bundle-optimization` or `image-optimization`)
- CI/CD pipeline changes need to be deployed (delegate to `@devops`)

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Define Performance Budgets

Establish quantitative budgets for each key performance metric.

**Core Web Vitals budgets:**

| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor | Our Budget |
|--------|------|-------------------|------|-----------|
| LCP | < 2.5s | 2.5-4.0s | > 4.0s | < 2.5s |
| INP | < 200ms | 200-500ms | > 500ms | < 200ms |
| CLS | < 0.1 | 0.1-0.25 | > 0.25 | < 0.1 |

**Resource budgets:**

| Resource | Budget | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Total JS (initial, gzipped) | < 100KB | First-load performance |
| Total JS (all, gzipped) | < 250KB | Total JS weight |
| Total CSS (gzipped) | < 50KB | Render-blocking potential |
| Total images (above fold) | < 200KB | LCP and initial load |
| Total page weight | < 1MB | Inclusive of all resources |
| Largest JS chunk | < 60KB | Code splitting effectiveness |
| Third-party JS | < 80KB | External dependency limit |
| Web fonts | < 100KB | Text rendering speed |

**Timing budgets:**

| Metric | Budget | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| TTFB | < 600ms | Server response time |
| FCP | < 1.8s | First visual content |
| LCP | < 2.5s | Largest content element |
| TTI | < 3.5s | Full interactivity |
| TBT | < 200ms | Main thread blocking |

**Per-route budgets (for SPAs):**
Different routes may have different budgets:
| Route | JS Budget | LCP Budget | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| / (homepage) | 80KB | 2.0s | Most critical route |
| /dashboard | 120KB | 2.5s | Data-heavy, more JS acceptable |
| /settings | 60KB | 2.0s | Simple page |
| /editor | 200KB | 3.0s | Complex, feature-rich |

**Output:** Performance budget document with all metrics defined.

### Step 2: Configure Lighthouse CI

Set up automated Lighthouse checks that run on every PR.

**Lighthouse CI configuration:**
```javascript
// lighthouserc.js
module.exports = {
  ci: {
    collect: {
      url: [
        'http://localhost:3000/',
        'http://localhost:3000/dashboard',
        'http://localhost:3000/settings',
      ],
      startServerCommand: 'npm run start',
      numberOfRuns: 3, // Median of 3 runs for stability
      settings: {
        preset: 'desktop',
        chromeFlags: '--no-sandbox',
      },
    },
    assert: {
      assertions: {
        'categories:performance': ['error', { minScore: 0.9 }],
        'categories:accessibility': ['error', { minScore: 0.9 }],
        'first-contentful-paint': ['warn', { maxNumericValue: 1800 }],
        'largest-contentful-paint': ['error', { maxNumericValue: 2500 }],
        'cumulative-layout-shift': ['error', { maxNumericValue: 0.1 }],
        'total-blocking-time': ['error', { maxNumericValue: 200 }],
        'interactive': ['warn', { maxNumericValue: 3500 }],
      },
    },
    upload: {
      target: 'temporary-public-storage', // Or self-hosted LHCI server
    },
  },
};
```

**CI integration (GitHub Actions):**
```yaml
- name: Lighthouse CI
  run: |
    npm install -g @lhci/cli
    lhci autorun
  env:
    LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN }}
```

**Assertion levels:**
- `error` — Fails the CI check, blocks merge
- `warn` — Shows warning in PR, does not block

**Output:** Lighthouse CI configuration file and CI integration.

### Step 3: Set Up Bundle Size Checks in CI

Monitor bundle size changes on every pull request.

**Option A: bundlewatch**
```javascript
// package.json
{
  "bundlewatch": {
    "files": [
      { "path": ".next/static/chunks/main-*.js", "maxSize": "100KB" },
      { "path": ".next/static/chunks/pages/_app-*.js", "maxSize": "60KB" },
      { "path": ".next/static/css/*.css", "maxSize": "30KB" }
    ],
    "defaultCompression": "gzip"
  }
}
```

**Option B: size-limit**
```javascript
// .size-limit.js
module.exports = [
  {
    path: '.next/static/chunks/main-*.js',
    limit: '100 KB',
    gzip: true,
  },
  {
    name: 'Initial JS',
    path: '.next/static/chunks/*.js',
    limit: '200 KB',
    gzip: true,
  },
];
```

**CI integration:**
```yaml
- name: Check bundle size
  run: npx size-limit
  # Fails if any budget is exceeded
```

**PR comment bot:**
Configure to post bundle size diff in PR comments:
```
Bundle Size Report

Package          | Current | Change  | Budget  | Status
initial.js       | 95KB    | +3KB    | 100KB   | OK
dashboard.chunk  | 58KB    | +12KB   | 60KB    | WARNING
total            | 185KB   | +15KB   | 250KB   | OK
```

**Output:** Bundle size monitoring configuration with CI integration.

### Step 4: Configure Real User Monitoring (RUM)

Set up field data collection from real users to complement lab data.

**web-vitals library (lightweight RUM):**
```typescript
// lib/analytics.ts
import { onLCP, onINP, onCLS, onFCP, onTTFB } from 'web-vitals';

function sendMetric(metric: { name: string; value: number; id: string }) {
  // Send to your analytics endpoint
  navigator.sendBeacon('/api/vitals', JSON.stringify({
    name: metric.name,
    value: metric.value,
    id: metric.id,
    page: window.location.pathname,
    connection: navigator.connection?.effectiveType,
    deviceMemory: navigator.deviceMemory,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  }));
}

// Register all Core Web Vitals
onLCP(sendMetric);
onINP(sendMetric);
onCLS(sendMetric);
onFCP(sendMetric);
onTTFB(sendMetric);
```

**Next.js built-in reporting:**
```typescript
// app/layout.tsx
export function reportWebVitals(metric: NextWebVitalsMetric) {
  switch (metric.name) {
    case 'LCP':
    case 'INP':
    case 'CLS':
      sendToAnalytics(metric);
      break;
  }
}
```

**RUM data storage and visualization:**
- Simple: Send to existing analytics (Google Analytics 4 has CWV support)
- Advanced: Send to a dedicated endpoint and visualize with Grafana/Datadog
- Google CrUX: Check CrUX data in Search Console for public metrics

**What to track:**
- All three Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS)
- Segment by: route, device type, connection speed, geography
- Track p75 (75th percentile — what Google uses for ranking)
- Alert on p75 regressions

**Output:** RUM configuration with data collection and storage setup.

### Step 5: Define Violation Thresholds

Establish clear thresholds for when a performance violation triggers action.

**Threshold levels:**

| Level | Condition | Action | Who |
|-------|-----------|--------|-----|
| **Green** | All metrics within budget | No action needed | Automated |
| **Yellow (Warning)** | Within 10% of budget | Add to tech debt backlog | perf-eng notified |
| **Orange (Approaching)** | Within 5% of budget | Must address this sprint | perf-eng reviews |
| **Red (Violation)** | Exceeds budget | Blocks deployment | perf-eng + team lead |

**Example thresholds for LCP (budget: 2.5s):**
| Level | Range | Trigger |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Green | < 2.25s | |
| Yellow | 2.25s - 2.375s | Backlog item created |
| Orange | 2.375s - 2.5s | Sprint priority |
| Red | > 2.5s | Deploy blocked |

**Example thresholds for JS size (budget: 100KB initial):**
| Level | Range | Trigger |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Green | < 90KB | |
| Yellow | 90-95KB | Backlog item created |
| Orange | 95-100KB | Sprint priority |
| Red | > 100KB | PR blocked by CI |

**Automated alerting:**
- CI failures post to team channel
- RUM threshold violations trigger alerts
- Weekly performance digest email/message

**Output:** Threshold definitions with automated triggers.

### Step 6: Document Escalation Process

Define what happens when a performance budget is violated.

**Escalation flow:**
```
1. CI check fails (Red threshold)
   ↓
2. PR author receives failure notification
   ↓
3. Author reviews Lighthouse CI / bundle size report
   ↓
4. Can the author fix it? → Yes → Fix and re-push
   ↓ No
5. @perf-eng reviews the regression
   ↓
6. @perf-eng determines:
   a. Fix is straightforward → provides fix guidance
   b. Budget needs adjustment → proposes new budget with justification
   c. Architecture issue → escalates to @frontend-arch
   ↓
7. Resolution documented in PR
```

**Budget exception process:**
Sometimes a new feature legitimately needs more JS. The exception process:
1. Author documents why the budget increase is necessary
2. @perf-eng reviews and approves/rejects
3. If approved, budget is increased with a note about what was added
4. A follow-up optimization task is created to bring it back down

**Weekly review:**
- Review RUM p75 trends for each route
- Compare lab data (Lighthouse CI) with field data (RUM)
- Identify routes approaching yellow thresholds
- Plan optimization work before violations occur

**Output:** Escalation process documentation.
