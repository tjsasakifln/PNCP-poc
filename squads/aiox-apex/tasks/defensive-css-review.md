  for overflow issues, text truncation problems, image sizing gaps, flex
  and grid minimum width bugs, validates with extreme content, and adds
  protective patterns where missing.

## When This Task Runs

This task runs when:
- A component or page has overflow or layout breakage bugs
- New components are being reviewed before production release
- Localization reveals layout issues with longer translated text
- QA reports visual breakage with unexpected content
- A defensive CSS audit is part of the component maturation process

This task does NOT run when:
- The issue is about design tokens or colors (route to `@design-sys-eng`)
- The issue is about animation or motion (route to `@motion-eng`)
- The issue requires a full layout rewrite (use `layout-strategy`)

---

## Defensive CSS Patterns

The following patterns should be applied where appropriate:

```yaml
patterns:
  overflow_protection:
    description: "Prevent content from breaking out of containers"
    priority: CRITICAL

  text_safety:
    description: "Handle text of any length gracefully"
    priority: CRITICAL

  image_resilience:
    description: "Images never break layout regardless of source"
    priority: HIGH

  flex_grid_guards:
    description: "Prevent flex/grid children from overflowing"
    priority: HIGH

  scroll_containment:
    description: "Prevent unintended scrollbars"
    priority: MEDIUM
```

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Scan for Overflow Issues

Identify elements that can overflow their containers:

1. Search for containers without explicit overflow handling:
   - Missing `overflow: hidden`, `overflow: auto`, or `overflow: clip`
   - Elements with fixed width/height containing dynamic content
2. Check for horizontal scrollbar triggers:
   - Elements with `width: 100vw` (does not account for scrollbar)
   - Absolutely positioned elements extending beyond viewport
   - Tables without `table-layout: fixed` or `overflow-x: auto`
3. Inspect elements with `position: absolute` or `position: fixed`:
   - Verify they do not create unexpected overflow
   - Check for missing `overflow: hidden` on containing blocks
4. Test by resizing the browser to various widths and observing overflow
5. Document each overflow issue with the selector and fix

### Step 2: Check Text Truncation and Wrapping

Ensure text handles all lengths gracefully:

1. **Long words without spaces:**
   - Apply `overflow-wrap: break-word` on text containers
   - Use `word-break: break-word` as fallback for older browsers
   - Consider `hyphens: auto` for natural word breaking
2. **Single-line text that must truncate:**
   ```css
   .truncate {
     white-space: nowrap;
     overflow: hidden;
     text-overflow: ellipsis;
   }
   ```
3. **Multi-line truncation:**
   ```css
   .line-clamp {
     display: -webkit-box;
     -webkit-line-clamp: 3;
     -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
     overflow: hidden;
   }
   ```
4. **Dynamic text in fixed containers:**
   - Verify `min-width` and `max-width` are set appropriately
   - Check that text does not push siblings off-screen
5. Test with strings: "W" (narrow), "WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW" (wide, no breaks), and a 200-character paragraph

### Step 3: Verify Image Aspect Ratio and Object Fit

Ensure images never break layout:

1. Check that all content images have:
   ```css
   img {
     max-width: 100%;
     height: auto;
   }
   ```
2. For images with a defined container:
   ```css
   .image-container {
     aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
   }
   .image-container img {
     width: 100%;
     height: 100%;
     object-fit: cover;
   }
   ```
3. Verify fallback for broken images:
   - Does the layout still work if the image fails to load?
   - Is there an `alt` text and a styled fallback?
4. Check background images:
   - `background-size: cover` or `contain` as appropriate
   - Fallback background color defined
5. Test with images of extreme aspect ratios (1:10, 10:1) and missing `src`

### Step 4: Test Flex and Grid min-width: 0

Prevent flex and grid children from overflowing:

1. **Flex children:**
   - Check all flex containers for children that could overflow
   - Apply `min-width: 0` to flex children containing text or content
   - Verify `flex-shrink` is not `0` unless intentional
   ```css
   .flex-child {
     min-width: 0; /* allows shrinking below content size */
   }
   ```
2. **Grid children:**
   - Apply `min-width: 0` and `min-height: 0` to grid children
   - Use `minmax(0, 1fr)` instead of `1fr` for tracks with overflow risk
   ```css
   .grid {
     grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr) minmax(0, 1fr);
   }
   ```
3. Check for flex items with `flex-basis: auto` containing long text
4. Verify no grid item pushes its track beyond the container

### Step 5: Validate with Extreme Content

Stress-test with content that real users might produce:

1. **Text extremes:**
   - Single character: "A"
   - Very long word: "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" or a URL
   - Very long paragraph: 500+ characters
   - Empty string: ""
   - Right-to-left text: Arabic or Hebrew characters
2. **Number extremes:**
   - "$0.01" vs "$1,000,000,000.00"
   - "1" vs "999,999"
3. **List extremes:**
   - 0 items, 1 item, 3 items, 50+ items
4. **Mixed content:**
   - Emoji in text: breaks line-height assumptions
   - Code snippets: monospace text with long lines
5. Document which components break and which defensive patterns fix them

### Step 6: Add Defensive Patterns

Apply fixes for all discovered issues:

1. Add the minimum defensive CSS to the global stylesheet:
   ```css
   /* Global defensive CSS */
   img, video, svg { max-width: 100%; height: auto; }
   * { min-width: 0; }
   ```
2. Apply component-specific fixes identified in Steps 1-5
3. Add CSS custom properties for defensive values when appropriate
4. Document each pattern added with its purpose
5. Verify no visual regressions were introduced by the defensive patterns
