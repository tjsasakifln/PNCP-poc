## When This Task Runs

This task runs when:
- A new animation needs spring physics tuning
- An existing spring animation does not feel right (too bouncy, too stiff, too slow)
- A motion language is being established for the design system
- Spring parameters need to be standardized across the product
- `*spring-config` or `*tune-spring` is invoked

This task does NOT run when:
- The animation does not use springs (though it probably should)
- A full animation design is needed (use `animation-design`)
- A full motion audit is needed (use `motion-audit`)

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Define Interaction Energy Level

Classify the interaction by its energy level — this determines the spring character.

| Energy Level | Description | Example Interactions |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Calm** | Low energy, passive, ambient | Background parallax, idle state, subtle breathing |
| **Gentle** | Low-medium energy, welcoming | Page enter, card reveal, drawer slide |
| **Responsive** | Medium energy, reactive | Button feedback, toggle, menu open |
| **Snappy** | Medium-high energy, decisive | Tab switch, chip select, quick dismiss |
| **Energetic** | High energy, celebratory | Success animation, confetti, bounce in |
| **Urgent** | Maximum energy, attention-grabbing | Error shake, notification pop, alert |

Ask:
- What emotion should this interaction convey? (Calm → Urgent spectrum)
- How important is this action to the user? (Low importance = calm, high importance = snappy)
- Is this a primary action or background decoration? (Primary = responsive+, background = calm)
- How frequently does this animation play? (Frequent = calmer to avoid fatigue, rare = can be more energetic)

**Output:** Energy level classification with rationale.

### Step 2: Select Base Spring Configuration

Map the energy level to a starting spring configuration.

**Spring parameter reference:**

| Parameter | What It Controls | Higher Value | Lower Value |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **stiffness** | How quickly the spring moves toward target | Faster, more responsive | Slower, more relaxed |
| **damping** | How quickly oscillation stops | Less bounce, quicker settle | More bounce, longer settle |
| **mass** | Inertia of the animated object | Slower start, heavier feel | Quicker start, lighter feel |

**Base configurations by energy level:**

```typescript
const springPresets = {
  calm: { stiffness: 80, damping: 15, mass: 1.2 },
  gentle: { stiffness: 120, damping: 14, mass: 1.0 },
  responsive: { stiffness: 200, damping: 20, mass: 1.0 },
  snappy: { stiffness: 300, damping: 25, mass: 0.8 },
  energetic: { stiffness: 400, damping: 10, mass: 0.8 },
  urgent: { stiffness: 500, damping: 30, mass: 0.6 },
};
```

**Damping ratio guide:**
- `damping ratio < 1` — underdamped (oscillates before settling — bouncy)
- `damping ratio = 1` — critically damped (fastest to settle without oscillation)
- `damping ratio > 1` — overdamped (slow to settle, no oscillation — sluggish)

Formula: `dampingRatio = damping / (2 * Math.sqrt(stiffness * mass))`

For most UI animations, target a damping ratio between 0.6 and 0.9 (slightly underdamped — a tiny bit of overshoot feels natural).

**Output:** Base spring configuration selected from presets.

### Step 3: Fine-Tune Stiffness, Damping, and Mass

Adjust the base configuration for the specific animation context.

**Tuning workflow:**
1. Start with the base preset from Step 2
2. Adjust stiffness first (speed of response)
3. Adjust damping second (amount of overshoot)
4. Adjust mass last (rarely needed, only for heavy/light feel)

**Stiffness tuning:**
- If animation feels too slow → increase stiffness by 50
- If animation feels too fast/aggressive → decrease stiffness by 50
- Keep stiffness between 50 (very slow) and 600 (very fast)

**Damping tuning:**
- If too much bounce → increase damping by 5
- If no character (feels dead) → decrease damping by 5
- Keep damping between 5 (very bouncy) and 40 (no bounce)

**Mass tuning:**
- If it should feel heavy (like dragging furniture) → increase mass to 1.5-2.0
- If it should feel light (like a notification) → decrease mass to 0.5-0.8
- Default mass of 1.0 is correct for most UI elements

**Interactive testing:**
```tsx
// Use Framer Motion DevTools or a custom spring playground
function SpringPlayground() {
  const [config, setConfig] = useState({ stiffness: 200, damping: 20, mass: 1 });
  return (
    <div>
      <input type="range" min={50} max={600} value={config.stiffness}
        onChange={(e) => setConfig(c => ({ ...c, stiffness: +e.target.value }))} />
      <motion.div
        animate={{ x: toggled ? 200 : 0 }}
        transition={{ type: "spring", ...config }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Output:** Fine-tuned spring configuration.

### Step 4: Test Feel on Real Device

Spring physics feel different on a real device versus a development monitor. Test on actual hardware.

**Testing protocol:**
1. Run the animation on the target device (phone, tablet, laptop)
2. Interact with it naturally (do not just watch — trigger it with a tap/click)
3. Trigger it repeatedly (10+ times) — does it feel consistent and satisfying each time?
4. Trigger it while distracted (not looking directly) — does it still feel right peripherally?
5. Ask someone unfamiliar with the project to interact — observe their reaction

**What to evaluate:**
- **Responsiveness:** Does the animation start immediately on interaction? (No perceived delay)
- **Momentum:** Does the motion feel like it has physical weight? (Not floaty, not jerky)
- **Settlement:** Does the animation come to rest cleanly? (No visible micro-oscillation at the end)
- **Interruption:** If triggered again mid-animation, does it respond naturally? (Springs handle this well)
- **Consistency:** Does it feel the same every time? (Springs are deterministic, so yes)

**Device testing:**
- Test on the slowest target device (performance affects perceived feel)
- Test with and without low power mode
- Test in portrait and landscape (if applicable)

**Output:** Real device feel test results.

### Step 5: Verify 60fps

Confirm the spring animation maintains 60fps throughout its duration.

**Measurement:**
- Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab → Record during animation
- Check frame timing: every frame should be <= 16.67ms
- Look for dropped frames (gaps in the frame timeline)

**Common spring fps issues:**
- Very low damping with high stiffness creates many oscillation frames (animation runs longer = more frames to render)
- Animating layout properties (width, height) with springs causes layout thrashing
- Multiple spring animations running simultaneously on complex DOM

**Solutions:**
- Use `will-change: transform` on animated elements
- Animate only transform and opacity
- If multiple springs run together, ensure they do not all update different layout properties
- Consider `layout` prop in Framer Motion for layout animations (automatically uses FLIP technique)

**Output:** 60fps verification with frame timing data.

### Step 6: Document Configuration with Rationale

Record the final spring configuration for reuse and team understanding.

```typescript
/**
 * Spring: Modal Enter
 * Energy: Gentle
 * Intent: Welcome the user to new content without startling
 *
 * Stiffness 150: Slightly slower than responsive — modal should
 *   feel like it's floating in, not snapping in
 * Damping 18: Slight overshoot (ratio ~0.73) — gives a sense
 *   of physical depth without feeling bouncy
 * Mass 1.0: Default weight — modal is a standard-sized element
 *
 * Settle time: ~400ms
 * Peak overshoot: ~3% scale
 */
export const modalEnterSpring = {
  type: "spring" as const,
  stiffness: 150,
  damping: 18,
  mass: 1.0,
};
```

Document:
- The energy level and intent
- Why each parameter value was chosen
- Approximate settle time
- Approximate peak overshoot percentage
- Which components use this configuration
- When to reuse this config vs. create a new one

**Output:** Documented spring configuration added to the motion token library.
