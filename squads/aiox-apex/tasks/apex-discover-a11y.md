## Command

### `*discover-a11y`

Static accessibility scan across all components (no browser needed).

## Discovery Phases

### Phase 1: Scan All Components

```yaml
scan:
  targets:
    - "All .tsx/.jsx files in src/"
    - "All .css/.scss files"
    - "tailwind.config.* for color definitions"

  exclude:
    - "test files (*.test.*, *.spec.*)"
    - "storybook files (*.stories.*)"
    - "node_modules/"
    - "build/dist output"
```

      - "Flag if < 4.5:1 for normal text"
      - "Flag if < 3:1 for large text (18px+ or 14px+ bold)"

    severity: HIGH

  heading_structure:
    description: "Heading hierarchy issues"
    patterns:
      - "Skipped heading level (h1 → h3, no h2)"
      - "Multiple h1 on same page"
      - "No h1 on page"

      - "Close buttons (X) smaller than 44x44"
    wcag: "2.5.8 Target Size Minimum (AA)"
    severity: MEDIUM
```

### Phase 3: Calculate A11y Health Score

```yaml
health_score:
  # **Score Formula SSoT:** `data/health-score-formulas.yaml#discover-a11y`. The inline formula below is kept for reference but the YAML file is authoritative.
  formula: "100 - (penalties)"
  penalties:
    critical_keyboard_trap: -15 each
    missing_alt: -5 each
    missing_form_label: -5 each
    low_contrast: -5 each
    aria_misuse: -3 each
    heading_skip: -2 each
    missing_focus_management: -5 each
    small_touch_target: -2 each

  classification:
    90-100: "accessible — strong a11y foundation"
    70-89: "good — some gaps to address"
    50-69: "needs_work — significant barriers present"
    0-49: "inaccessible — major barriers for users with disabilities"
```

### Phase 4: Output

```yaml
output_format: |
  ## Accessibility Discovery
