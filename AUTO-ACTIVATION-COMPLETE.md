## 🚀 Quick Start

### See Automatic Context Detection

```bash
node .aios-core/development/scripts/bidiq-greeting-system.js
```

Example output:
```
🐍 BidIQ Development Assistant

📍 Detected: Backend Development
   Modified: 5 backend files
   Branch: feature/issue-31
   Story: story-2-1 (50% complete)

💡 Recommended: Team BidIQ Backend
   Agents: architect, dev, data-engineer, qa
   Confidence: 95%

🚀 Next Steps:
   1. /bidiq backend
   2. *develop
```

### Get Full Project Analysis

```bash
node .aios-core/development/scripts/bidiq-context-detector.js
```

Shows:
- Git status (branch, commits, changes)
- Story progress (in progress, completed, blocked)
- Test coverage and failures
- Actionable recommendations

### Activate Squad

```bash
/bidiq backend   # Backend development
/bidiq frontend  # Frontend development
/bidiq feature   # Complete features
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### Context Detection (5 Signals)

The system analyzes:

1. **Directory** (30% weight)
   - `backend/` → Backend squad
   - `frontend/` → Frontend squad
   - `docs/stories/` → Feature squad

2. **Git Branch** (25% weight)
   - `feature/*` → Feature squad
   - `fix/*` → Backend squad

3. **Modified Files** (25% weight)
   - Backend files → Backend squad
   - Frontend files → Frontend squad
   - Both → Feature squad

4. **Story Status** (15% weight)
   - In progress → Relevant squad
   - Pending → Feature squad
   - Blocked → Alert

5. **Test Status** (5% weight)
   - Coverage monitoring
   - Failure detection

### Confidence Calculation

```
Base: 50%
+ Directory match: +30%
+ Branch match: +25%
+ File match: +25%
+ Story activity: +15%
+ Test status: +5%
= Total 0-100% (only suggest if >= 40%)
```
