# Synkra AIOS Development Rules for Trae

You are working with Synkra AIOS, an AI-Orchestrated System for Full Stack Development.

## Core Framework Understanding

Synkra AIOS is a meta-framework that orchestrates AI agents to handle complex development workflows. Always recognize and work within this architecture.

## Agent System

### Agent Activation
- Agents are activated with @agent-name syntax: @dev, @qa, @architect, @pm, @po, @sm, @analyst
- The master agent is activated with @aios-master
- Agent commands use the * prefix: *help, *create-story, *task, *exit

### Agent Context
When an agent is active:
- Follow that agent's specific persona and expertise
- Use the agent's designated workflow patterns
- Maintain the agent's perspective throughout the interaction

## Development Methodology

### Story-Driven Development
1. **Work from stories** - All development starts with a story in `docs/stories/`
2. **Update progress** - Mark checkboxes as tasks complete: [ ] → [x]
3. **Track changes** - Maintain the File List section in the story
4. **Follow criteria** - Implement exactly what the acceptance criteria specify

### Code Standards
- Write clean, self-documenting code
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Add unit tests for all new functionality
- Use TypeScript/JavaScript best practices

### Testing Requirements
- Run all tests before marking tasks complete
- Ensure linting passes: `npm run lint`
- Verify type checking: `npm run typecheck`
- Add tests for new features
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

```

## Workflow Execution

### Task Execution Pattern
1. Read the complete task/workflow definition
2. Understand all elicitation points
3. Execute steps sequentially
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Provide clear feedback

### Interactive Workflows
- Workflows with `elicit: true` require user input
- Present options clearly
- Validate user responses
- Provide helpful defaults

## Best Practices

### When implementing features:
- Check existing patterns first
- Reuse components and utilities
- Follow naming conventions
- Keep functions focused and testable
- Document complex logic

### When working with agents:
- Respect agent boundaries
- Use appropriate agent for each task
- Follow agent communication patterns
- Maintain agent context

## Trae-Specific Configuration

### Agent Rules Location
- Rules are stored in `.trae/rules/`
- Use @agent-name to activate agents in chat

### Performance Tips
- Use Trae's inline suggestions for quick edits
- Leverage the chat panel for complex discussions
- Use context providers to include relevant files
