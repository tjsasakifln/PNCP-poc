# Validation Notes:
# - Patterns cross-referenced with Epic 6.1 workflow analysis
# - Commands verified against actual project usage in .aios-core/agents/*.md
# - Agent sequences match actual workflow patterns from recent stories
# - Threshold of 2 ensures workflow detection is accurate but not overly sensitive
# - All 10 workflows now have transition definitions (Story WIS-2)
