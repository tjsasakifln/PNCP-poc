      notes: |
        CRITICAL FIRST STEP - Run before any planning:
        - @devops → *environment-bootstrap
        - Verifies/installs CLIs (git, gh, node, supabase, railway)
        - Authenticates services (GitHub, Supabase, Railway)
        - Creates Git repository locally and on GitHub
        - Scaffolds AIOS project structure
        - Generates environment report

        SKIP CONDITIONS:
        - Only skip if project already has .aios/environment-report.json
        - Re-run if switching machines or team members join

      action: guide_development_sequence
      notes: "Based on PRD stories: If stories are frontend-heavy, start with frontend project/directory first. If backend-heavy or API-first, start with backend. For tightly coupled features, follow story sequence in monorepo setup. Reference sharded PRD epics for development order."
