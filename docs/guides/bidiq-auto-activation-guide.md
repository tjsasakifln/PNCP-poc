# BidIQ Proactive Squad Activation Guide

**Status:** Auto-activation system ready
**Version:** 1.0
**Framework:** Synkra AIOS + Smart Context Detection

---

## Overview

Never worry about which squad to activate. BidIQ's intelligent context detection automatically:

✅ **Detects your context** - Analyzes what you're doing
✅ **Suggests squad proactively** - Offers the right squad automatically
✅ **Guides next steps** - Shows exactly what to do next
✅ **Tracks progress** - Monitors story status and test coverage

---

## How It Works

### 1️⃣ Automatic Detection (Session Start)

When you start work, the system automatically:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Analyzing BidIQ Project Context...      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
          ↓
  ┌─────────────────────────┐
  │ Context Signals:        │
  │ • Directory: backend/   │
  │ • Branch: feature/fix   │
  │ • Files: 5 modified     │
  │ • Story: In progress    │
  └─────────────────────────┘
          ↓
  ┌─────────────────────────┐
  │ Confidence: 95%         │
  │ Squad: Backend ✅       │
  └─────────────────────────┘
```

### 2️⃣ Adaptive Greeting

You see a personalized greeting:

```
🐍 BidIQ Development Assistant

📍 Detected: 🐍 Backend Development
   Modified: 5 backend files, 2 frontend files
   Branch: feature/issue-31-production-deployment

💡 Recommended Squad:
   🐍 Team BidIQ Backend
   FastAPI development, PNCP client, database work
   Agents: architect, dev, data-engineer, qa
   Confidence: 95%

🚀 Next Steps:
   1. Type: /bidiq backend
   2. Use: *help (for command reference)
   3. Start: *develop (to begin implementation)

─────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### 3️⃣ Intelligent Suggestions

Throughout your session, system proactively suggests:

- **Coverage alerts** - "Backend coverage 65% (target: 70%)"
- **Story progress** - "5 of 8 tasks complete"
- **Test failures** - "2 tests failing in pncp_client.py"
- **Uncommitted changes** - "3 files with uncommitted changes"

### 4️⃣ Exit Guidance (When Leaving Squad)

When you exit a squad, you see:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
🔄 Exiting team-bidiq-backend
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

---

## Configuration

### Enable Auto-Activation

The system is configured in `.aios-core/development/configs/bidiq-activation-config.yaml`:

```yaml
activation:
  enabled: true              # Global enable/disable
  greeting_on_start: true    # Show greeting on session start
  context_detection: true    # Detect context automatically
  auto_suggest: true         # Suggest squads proactively

greeting:
  confidence_threshold: 40   # Only suggest if >= 40% confident
  show_context: true         # Show detected context
  show_recommendations: true # Show action recommendations
```

### Customize Detection Rules

Add your own context detection rules in the config:

```yaml
context_rules:
  backend:
    directories:
      - backend/
      - backend/**/*.py
    branches:
      - feature/backend-*
    squad: team-bidiq-backend
    confidence_boost: 20
```

---

## Manual Activation (When Auto Doesn't Work)

If auto-detection doesn't trigger, manually activate:

```bash
# See your context
node .aios-core/development/scripts/bidiq-greeting-system.js

# Get full project analysis
node .aios-core/development/scripts/bidiq-context-detector.js

# Or manually activate
/bidiq backend
/bidiq frontend
/bidiq feature
```

---

## What Gets Detected

### Context Signals

The system analyzes multiple signals:

| Signal | Examples | Weight |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Directory** | `backend/`, `frontend/`, `docs/stories/` | 30% |
| **Git Branch** | `feature/*`, `fix/*`, main | 25% |
| **Modified Files** | Which files you changed | 25% |
| **Story Status** | In progress, pending, blocked | 15% |
| **Test Status** | Coverage, failures | 5% |

### Confidence Calculation

```
Base Confidence: 50%

+ Directory match: +30%
+ Branch match: +25%
+ File match: +20%
+ Story activity: +10%
+ Test status: +5%

= Total Confidence (0-100%)
```

Only suggestions with ≥40% confidence are shown.

---

## Proactive Alerts

System proactively notifies you about:

### 🔴 Critical Issues
- Test failures preventing merge
- Blocked stories
- Missing required commits

### 🟠 High Priority
- Coverage below threshold (70%/60%)
- Uncommitted changes
- Incomplete stories

### 🟡 Medium Priority
- Outdated branches
- Large pending changelist
- Multiple pending stories

---

## Integration Points

### With Your Workflow

The auto-activation integrates at these points:

```
Session Start
    ↓
detect context → show greeting → suggest squad
    ↓
User activates squad
    ↓
Work in squad
    ↓
Exit squad
    ↓
show summary → suggest next steps → ask for commit
    ↓
Continue or switch squads
```

### With Git

Detects:
- Branch name and type
- Uncommitted changes
- Commits ahead of main
- File modifications

### With Stories

Monitors:
- Active stories
- Task completion %
- Blockers
- Story status

### With Tests

Checks:
- Coverage %
- Test pass/fail
- Coverage trends

## Tips & Tricks

### Fast Squad Activation

If detection doesn't trigger:
```bash
# Quick manual activation
/bidiq backend
/bidiq frontend
/bidiq feature
```

### See Your Context

```bash
# Understand why squad was suggested
node .aios-core/development/scripts/bidiq-greeting-system.js

# Get full project analysis
node .aios-core/development/scripts/bidiq-context-detector.js
```

### Monitor Progress

```bash
# Check real-time status (coming Week 2)
/bidiq status

# See test coverage
pytest --cov              # Backend
npm test --coverage       # Frontend
```

### Custom Suggestions

Edit `.aios-core/development/configs/bidiq-activation-config.yaml` to customize detection rules for your workflow.

## Troubleshooting

### Squad Not Activating Automatically?

**Check:**
1. Are you in a BidIQ project? (CLAUDE.md should exist)
2. Is `activation.enabled: true` in bidiq-activation-config.yaml?
3. Is confidence ≥ 40%?

**Fix:**
```bash
# See what's detected
node .aios-core/development/scripts/bidiq-greeting-system.js

# Manually activate if needed
/bidiq [backend|frontend|feature]
```

### Suggestions Not Appearing?

**Check:**
1. Is `greeting.show_recommendations: true`?
2. Is context detection enabled?

**Fix:**
```bash
# See analysis
node .aios-core/development/scripts/bidiq-context-detector.js

# Re-run greeting
node .aios-core/development/scripts/bidiq-greeting-system.js
```

### Wrong Squad Suggested?

The system uses multiple signals. To improve accuracy:

1. **Use descriptive branch names:** `feature/pncp-pagination`
2. **Work in correct directory:** `backend/` for Python code
3. **Keep one story active:** Prevents confusion
4. **Commit frequently:** Makes file status clearer
