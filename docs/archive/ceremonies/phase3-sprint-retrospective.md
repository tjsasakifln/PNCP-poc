- **Item 2:** [To be filled during meeting]
- **Item 3:** [To be filled during meeting]

### Preliminary Observations (Pre-Meeting Analysis)

Based on Phase 3 documentation review, likely friction points:

1. **❌ Frontend Coverage Below Threshold (49.61% vs. 60% target)**
   - **Evidence:** Test Report shows 49.61% coverage, 7 tests failing
   - **Root cause:** Tests written AFTER implementation (not TDD)
   - **Stop doing:** Implementing features without writing tests first
   - **Impact:** MEDIUM (technical debt + false confidence)

2. **⏳ Dependency on Missing Components (IMP-001: LoadingProgress.tsx)**
   - **Evidence:** @dev expected LoadingProgress.tsx to exist but had to create it
   - **Root cause:** Incomplete Phase 2 handoff (assumed base component existed)
   - **Stop doing:** Starting implementation without validating all dependencies
   - **Impact:** LOW (resolved in 10 min but could have been prevented)

3. **🔀 Edge Case Tests Deferred (7 P2 bugs to Week 2)**
   - **Evidence:** useOnboarding auto-start edge cases, EnhancedLoadingProgress overflow
   - **Root cause:** Time pressure prioritized happy path over edge cases
   - **Stop doing:** Deferring edge case testing when time-boxed sprints
   - **Impact:** LOW (non-blocking bugs but user experience risk)

4. **📦 Library Not Pre-Installed (IMP-002: Shepherd.js)**
   - **Evidence:** npm install shepherd.js required on Day 8 (5 min delay)
   - **Root cause:** Technology choices (ADR-003) not followed by immediate installation
   - **Stop doing:** Separating architecture decisions from setup tasks
   - **Impact:** LOW (5 min impediment but could compound)

5. **🔄 Manual Test Execution (No CI/CD for frontend tests yet)**
   - **Evidence:** Tests run manually via `npm test`, not in staging-deploy.yml
   - **Root cause:** CI/CD preparation focused on deployment, not test automation
   - **Stop doing:** Treating test automation as separate from deployment pipeline
   - **Impact:** MEDIUM (risk of deploying broken code)

   - **Continue:** Require ADR before implementing new libraries/patterns
   - **Impact:** MEDIUM (future teams understand "why")

4. **✅ QA Sign-off Process (Test Report + Approval)**
   - **Evidence:** phase3-test-report.md with clear APPROVED/REJECTED status
   - **Sustainability:** @qa creates test report at end of every phase
   - **Continue:** No deployment without explicit QA sign-off
   - **Impact:** HIGH (prevents production incidents)

5. **✅ Burn-Down Chart Tracking (@pm Morgan)**
   - **Evidence:** burn-down-chart-phase3.md updated daily with SP progress
   - **Sustainability:** @pm updates after each daily standup
   - **Continue:** Track velocity daily for multi-day phases (not single-day)
   - **Impact:** MEDIUM (early warning for velocity issues)

6. **✅ Cross-Browser Testing (6 browsers validated)**
