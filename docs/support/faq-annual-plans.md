## Billing & Pricing

### How much do I save with an annual plan?

**Answer:** You save exactly **20%** compared to paying monthly for 12 months. This is equivalent to getting **2.4 months free**.

**Price Comparison:**

| Plan | Monthly × 12 | Annual Price | You Save |
|------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Consultor Ágil** | R$ 3,564 | **R$ 2,851** | R$ 713 (20%) |
| **Máquina** | R$ 7,164 | **R$ 5,731** | R$ 1,433 (20%) |
| **Sala de Guerra** | R$ 17,952 | **R$ 14,362** | R$ 3,590 (20%) |

---

### When am I charged for annual plans?

**Answer:** You're charged **upfront** for the full year when you subscribe or upgrade to an annual plan.

**Example Timeline:**
- **Feb 7, 2026:** Subscribe to Consultor Ágil Annual (R$ 2,851 charged immediately)
- **Feb 7, 2027:** Renewal (R$ 2,851 charged again unless canceled)

**Monthly Plans (for comparison):**
- Charged on the same day each month (e.g., 7th of every month)

---

### Can I switch from monthly to annual mid-cycle?

**Answer:** Yes! You can upgrade from monthly to annual anytime.

**How It Works:**
1. You'll receive a **pro-rated credit** for the unused portion of your current monthly period
2. Your annual subscription starts immediately
3. You're charged the annual amount minus the credit

**Example:**
- Current plan: Consultor Ágil Monthly (R$ 297/month)
- 15 days remaining in your monthly period
- Unused credit: R$ 148.50 (15/30 × R$ 297)
- You pay: R$ 2,851 - R$ 148.50 = **R$ 2,702.50** upfront
- Next charge: Feb 7, 2027 (12 months from upgrade)

**No Penalties:** You can upgrade anytime without losing money.

---

### What happens at renewal time?

**Answer:** Your annual subscription automatically renews unless you cancel before the renewal date.

**Renewal Process:**
1. **7 days before renewal:** We'll send a reminder email with the renewal amount
2. **Renewal date:** Your payment method on file is charged automatically
3. **After renewal:** You receive a receipt and your subscription continues for another year

**To Avoid Renewal:** Cancel at least 24 hours before your renewal date. You'll retain access until the end of your paid period.

---

### Are there any setup fees or hidden charges?

**Answer:** No. The annual price you see is the total amount you pay for 12 months. There are no:
- Setup fees
- Activation fees
- Early termination fees (within 7 days - see refund policy)
- Overage charges

**Additional Costs (Optional):**
- Extra user seats (if you need more than included in your plan)
- Premium add-ons (future features not included in base plans)

---

## Refunds & Cancellations

2. **Cancel completely** and stop all charges

**Example:**

|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **March 1, 2026** | 🎯 Proactive Search launches | 🚫 Not available yet |

---

### Can I access annual-only features on a monthly plan?

**Answer:** No. Annual-exclusive features (Early Access, Proactive Search, AI Edital Analysis) are only available to annual subscribers.

**Why?**
- Annual subscribers commit upfront and help fund development of advanced features
- Exclusive benefits reward long-term commitment

**How to Get Access:**
- Upgrade to an annual plan anytime
- You'll receive pro-rated credit for your remaining monthly time
- Features activate immediately

---

### What happens to my annual benefits if I downgrade?

**Answer:** You **keep all annual benefits** until the end of your current annual period. After that, you lose access to annual-exclusive features.

**Example:**
- Annual plan purchased: Jan 1, 2026
- Request downgrade to monthly: March 1, 2026
- **Until Dec 31, 2026:** You keep early access, proactive search, AI analysis
- **Jan 1, 2027:** Convert to monthly billing, annual-exclusive features revoked

**What You Keep on Monthly:**
- Core plan features (unlimited searches, exports, notifications)
- Your plan tier (Consultor / Máquina / Sala de Guerra)
- All previously generated reports (read-only)

---

## Switching Plans

### Can I change my plan tier (e.g., Consultor → Máquina) while on annual billing?

**Answer:** Yes! You can upgrade or downgrade your plan tier anytime.

**How It Works:**

**Upgrading (Consultor → Máquina):**
1. You'll be charged the **pro-rated difference** between your current annual plan and the new annual plan
2. Your subscription end date stays the same

**Example:**
- Current: Consultor Ágil Annual (R$ 2,851/year)
- Upgrade to: Máquina Annual (R$ 5,731/year)
- 6 months remaining in annual period
- Pro-rated charge: (R$ 5,731 - R$ 2,851) / 12 × 6 = **R$ 1,440**

**Downgrading (Máquina → Consultor):**
1. You'll receive a **pro-rated credit** for the difference
2. Credit applied to your next renewal invoice

**To Change Plan Tier:** Go to **Account Settings** → **Change Plan** → Select new plan.

---

### Can I switch from annual to monthly and back to annual?

**Answer:** Yes, but you'll lose your pro-rated time.

**Scenario:**
1. **Jan 1, 2026:** Subscribe to annual (R$ 2,851) - expires Dec 31, 2026
2. **March 1, 2026:** Switch to monthly (no refund, but keep benefits until Dec 31)
3. **June 1, 2026:** Want to switch back to annual
   - You'll be charged full annual price (R$ 2,851) again
   - New expiration: May 31, 2027
   - You **won't** get credit for remaining time from previous annual (June-Dec 2026)

**Recommendation:** Stick with annual unless you're certain you want to downgrade.

---

### What if I need to pause my subscription temporarily?

**Answer:** We don't offer subscription pausing, but you have options:

**Option 1: Keep Subscription Active**
- Cancel auto-renewal
- Keep access until your annual period ends
- Resubscribe when ready (within 30 days to keep data)

**Option 2: Downgrade to Lowest Plan**
- Switch to Consultor Ágil (monthly or annual)
- Minimal cost to keep account active
- Upgrade when ready

**Option 3: Cancel + Resubscribe**
- Cancel now (keep benefits until period end if annual)
- Resubscribe within 30 days to restore data

**Future Feature:** Subscription pausing is on our roadmap for Q3 2026.

---

- We'll retry immediately after you update

---

### Are annual subscriptions subject to price increases?

**Answer:** Your annual price is **locked in** for the duration of your subscription.

**Example:**
- You subscribe on Feb 1, 2026 at R$ 2,851/year
- We increase prices to R$ 3,200/year on July 1, 2026
- Your renewal on Feb 1, 2027 is still R$ 2,851 (old price)
- Price increase applies to your second renewal (Feb 1, 2028)

**Protection:** You'll always get at least 30 days' notice of price changes before they affect your renewal.
